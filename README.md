Instead of being the things you count to make yourself fall asleep, sheep are fun and dynamic creatures that help you learn about binary heaps!

Binary SheepTM is a game constructed entirely in Java that educates a user in the manner in which a maximum binary heap is assembled. The user hits play, and has to swap the numbered sheep within a certain number of moves to restore the maximum binary heap order, or they lose. So as not to strand the player, there is an instructions menu with details about what constitutes a maximum binary heap and explains gameplay. The interactive format of this game allows for many possible results, all of which are fun and educational.
